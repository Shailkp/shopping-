            within the specified return/exchange period (check product details page for the same). We only ask that you don't use 
            the product and preserve its original condition, tags, and packaging. You are welcome to try on a product but please 
            take adequate measure to preserve its condition. There are two ways to return the product to us: <br>


            Pick up: In most locations, we offer a free pick up service. You will see a pickup option when you submit a return request.
            Self-Ship: If we don't offer a pick up at your location. In such cases, we will credit the shipping costs in the form of 
            Myntra credits provided the product meets the return policy and you have shared scan copy of the courier receipt with us.</p><br>
            
            During Pick Up, our delivery agent may do a quality check on the return. For a successful pick up, we will initiate a doorstep 
            refund for the return amount into the refund mode selected at the time of initiating the return request. This doorstep refund 
            may not be applicable for some pin codes in which case refund will be initiated after the product has been received at our
